## 1. Introduction

Instructions: Provide identifying information for the existing and/or proposed automated system or situation for which the System Design Document (SDD) applies (e.g., the full names and acronyms for the development project, the existing system or situation, and the proposed system or situation, as applicable), and expected evolution of the document. Also describe any security or privacy considerations associated with use of this document.

The System Design Document (SDD) describes how the functional and nonfunctional requirements recorded in the Requirements Document, the preliminary user-oriented functional design recorded in the High Level Technical Design Concept/Alternatives document, and the preliminary data design documented in the Logical Data Model (LDM) transform into more technical system design specifications from which the system is built. The SDD documents the high-level system design and the low-level detailed design specifications.

The SDD describes design goals and considerations, provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, and describes the data design associated with the system, as well as the human-machine interface and operational scenarios. The high-level system design is further decomposed into low-level detailed design specifications for each system component, including hardware, internal communications, software, system integrity controls, and external interfaces. The high-level system design serves as primary input to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The low-level detailed design serves as input to the Detailed Design Review (DDR).

### 1.1 Purpose of the SDD

Instructions: Provide the purpose of the SDD. This document should be tailored to fit a particular project's needs.

The SDD documents and tracks the necessary information required to effectively define architecture and system design in order to give the development team guidance on the architecture of the system to be developed. Design documents are incrementally and iteratively produced during the system development life cycle, based on the particular circumstances of the information technology (IT) project and the system development methodology used for developing the system. Its intended audience is the project manager, project team, and development team. Some portions of this document, such as the user interface (UI), may be shared with the client/user, and other stakeholders whose input/approval into the UI is needed.

## 2. General Overview and Design Guidelines/Approach

This section describes the principles and strategies to be used as guidelines when designing and implementing the system.

### 2.1 General Overview

Instructions: Briefly introduce the system context and the basic design approach or organization. Provide a brief overview of the system and software architectures and the design goals. Include the high-level context diagram(s) for the system and subsystems previously provided in the High-Level Technical Design Concept/Alternatives and/or Requirements Document, updated as necessary to reflect any changes that have been made based on more current information or understanding. If the high-level context diagram has been updated, identify the changes that were made and why.

### 2.2 Assumptions/Constraints/Risks

#### 2.2.1 Assumptions

Instructions: Describe any assumptions or dependencies regarding the system, software and its use. These may concern such issues as: related software or hardware, operating systems, end-user characteristics, and possible and/or probable changes in functionality.

#### 2.2.2 Constraints

Instructions: Describe any global limitations or constraints that have a significant impact on the design of the system's hardware, software and/or communications, and describe the associated impact. Such constraints may be imposed by any of the following (the list is not exhaustive):

- Hardware or software environment
- End-user environment
- Availability or volatility of resources
- Standards compliance
- Interoperability requirements
- Interface/protocol requirements
- Licensing requirements
- Data repository and distribution requirements
- Security requirements (or other such regulations)
- Memory or other capacity limitations
- Performance requirements
- Network communications
- Verification and validation requirements (testing)
- Other means of addressing quality goals
- Other requirements described in the Requirements Document

#### 2.2.3 Risks

Instructions: Describe any risks associated with the system design and proposed mitigation strategies.

### 2.3 Alignment with Federal Enterprise Architecture

Instructions: Describe alignment with FEA.

## 3. Design Considerations

Instructions: Describe issues which need to be addressed or resolved before attempting to devise a complete design solution.

### 3.1 Goals and Guidelines

Instructions: Describe any goals, guidelines, principles, or priorities which dominate or embody the design of the system and its software. Examples of such goals might be: an emphasis on speed versus memory use; or working, looking, or "feeling" like an existing product. Guidelines include coding guidelines and conventions. For each such goal or guideline, describe the reason for its desirability unless it is implicitly obvious. Describe any design policies and/or tactics that do not have sweeping architectural implications (meaning they would not significantly affect the overall organization of the system and its high-level structures), but which nonetheless affect the details of the interface and/or implementation of various aspects of the system (e.g., choice of which specific product to use).

### 3.2 Development Methods & Contingencies

Instructions: Briefly describe the method or approach used for the system and software design (e.g., structured, object-oriented, prototyping, J2EE, UML, XML, etc.). If one or more formal/ published methods were adopted or adapted, then include a reference to a more detailed description of these methods. If several methods were seriously considered, then each such method should be mentioned, along with a brief explanation of why all or part of it was used or not used. Describe any contingencies that might arise in the design of the system and software that may change the development direction. Possibilities include lack of interface agreements with outside agencies or unstable architectures at the time the SDD is prepared. Address any possible workarounds or alternative plans.

### 3.3 Architectural Strategies

Instructions: Describe any design decisions and/or strategies that affect the overall organization of the system and its higher-level structures. These strategies should provide insight into the key abstractions and mechanisms used in the system architecture. Describe the reasoning employed for each decision and/or strategy (possibly referring to previously stated design goals and principles) and how any design goals or priorities were balanced or traded-off.

Describe compliance with CMS Enterprise Architecture (EA) and standards. Specifically identify any deviations that were made from the CMS EA and standards, and provide rationale to support the deviation(s). When describing a design decision, discuss any other significant alternatives that were considered, and the reasons for rejecting them (as well as the reasons for accepting the alternative finally chosen). Sometimes it may be most effective to employ the "pattern format" for describing a strategy.

Examples of design decisions might concern (but are not limited to) things like the following:

- Use of a particular type of product (programming language, database, library, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, etc.)
- Reuse of existing software components to implement various parts/features of the system
- Future plans for extending or enhancing the software
- User interface paradigms (or system input and output models)
- Hardware and/or software interface paradigms
- Error detection and recovery
- Memory management policies
- External databases and/or data storage management and persistence
- Distributed data or control over a network
- Generalized approaches to control
- Concurrency and synchronization
- Communication mechanisms
- Management of other resources

### 3.4 Performance Engineering

Instructions:

Using the Performance Requirements defined in the Requirements Document, provide a detailed explanation that describes how the Performance Requirements were incorporated into the system's design. Please refer to Sections 2.0 of the CMS Performance Test Plan and Results Template for guidance on defining Performance Requirements.

Start preparing Production Load Model(s) in preparation for Performance testing. Please refer to Sections 2.1.1 of the CMS Performance Test Plan and Results Template for guidance on Load Model construction.

Performance requirements are a contributing factor to system design.

Performance requirements are the defined scalability or responsiveness expectations of specific workloads that process on a system.

## 4. System Architecture and Architecture Design

Instructions: Describe the system architecture, how the application interacts with other applications. Not necessarily how the application itself works but, how the appropriate data is correctly passed between applications. Provide an overview of how the functionality and responsibilities of the system were partitioned and then assigned to subsystems or components. Don't go into too much detail about the individual components themselves in this section. A subsequent section of the SDD will provide the detailed component descriptions. The main purpose here is to gain a general understanding of how and why the system was decomposed, and how the individual parts work together to provide the desired functionality.

At the top-most level, describe the major responsibilities that the software must undertake and the various roles that the system (or portion of the system) must play. Describe how the system was broken down into its components/subsystems (identifying each top-level component/subsystem and the roles/responsibilities assigned to it). Describe how the higher-level components collaborate with each other in order to achieve the required results. Provide some sort of rationale for choosing this particular decomposition of the system (perhaps discussing other proposed decompositions and why they were rejected).

Make use of design patterns whenever possible, either in describing parts of the architecture (in pattern format), or for referring to elements of the architecture that employ them. Provide rationale for choosing a particular algorithm or programming idiom (or design pattern) to implement portions of the system's functionality.

This section outlines the system and hardware architecture design of the system.

### 4.1 Logical View

Instructions: Insert any related logical views or provide a reference to where they are stored.

### 4.2 Hardware Architecture

Instructions: Describe the overall system hardware and organization, indicating whether the processing system is distributed or centralized.

Instructions: Describe the hardware components and configuration supporting the performance and reliability of the system. Identify single points of failure and, if relevant, describe high availability design (e.g., clustering).

### 4.3 Software Architecture

Instructions: Describe all software that is needed to support the system, the hardware component for which each software component is targeted, and specify the physical location of all software systems. List such things as logical components (e.g., JSP in presentation layer, JNDI in application layer, EJB and JDBC in data layer), database platforms, computer languages, compilers, utilities, operating systems, communications software, programming computer-aided software engineering tools, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, open source frameworks, etc., with a brief description of the function of each item and any identifying information such as manufacturer, version number, number and types of licenses needed, etc., as appropriate. Identify all Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs), Computer Software Components (CSCs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to include name, type, purpose and function for each; the interfaces, messaging, and protocols for those elements; and rationale for the software architectural design. Include software modules that are functions, subroutines, or classes. Use functional hierarchy diagrams, structured organization diagrams (e.g., structure charts), or object-oriented diagrams that show the various segmentation levels down to the lowest level. All features on the diagrams should have reference numbers and names.

Include a narrative that expands on and enhances the understanding of the functional breakdown. If necessary, describe how a component was further divided into subcomponents, and the relationships and interactions between the subcomponents. Proceed into as many levels/subsections of discussion as needed in order to provide a high-level understanding of the entire system or subsystem, leaving the details for inclusion in a later section of the SDD. Include data flow diagrams that conform to appropriate standards (e.g., Yourdon-Demarco conventions) and provide the physical process and data flow related to the logical process and data flow decomposed to the primitive process level (describing how each input is processed/transformed into the resulting output). If there are parts of the system that already existed before this development effort began, then only describe the relationships and interactions between the old parts and the new parts. Pre-existing parts that are modified or enhanced need to be described only to the extent that is necessary to provide a sufficient understanding of the nature of the changes that are being made.

#### 4.3.1 Security Software Architecture

Instructions: Describe the software components and configuration supporting the security and privacy of the system. Specify the architecture for (1) authentication to validate user identity before allowing access to the system, including the use of IACS/EUA or other type of Identity Vetting & Authentication system;(2) authorization of users to perform functional activity once logged into the system, (3) encryption protocol to support the business risks and the nature of information, and (4) logging and auditing design, if required. The design should be based on the designated system security level and provide adequate protection against threats and vulnerabilities.

Factors that distinguish a user class include common responsibilities, skill levels, work activities, and modes of interaction with the system. In this context, a user is anyone who interacts with the proposed system, including operational users, data entry personnel, system operators, operational support personnel, system maintainers, and trainers. For each user class, provide estimates of the total number of users anticipated, a maximum number of concurrent users, and the number of external users.

#### 5.4.1 Inputs

Instructions: Provide a description of the input media used by the user/operator for providing information to the system. Show a mapping to the high-level data flows (e.g., data entry screens, optical character readers, bar scanners, etc.). If appropriate, the input record types, file structures, and database structures provided in the section for Data Design, may be referenced. Include data element definitions, or refer to the data dictionary. Provide the layout of all input data screens or graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (e.g., windows). Define all data elements associated with each screen or GUI, or reference the data dictionary. Provide edit criteria for the data elements, including specific values, range of values, mandatory/optional, alphanumeric values, and length. Also address data entry controls to prevent edit bypassing. Discuss the miscellaneous messages associated with user/operator inputs, including (but not limited to) the following:

## 6. Operational Scenarios

Instructions: Describe the general functionality of the system from the users' perspectives and provide an execution or operational flow of the system via operational scenarios that provide step-by-step descriptions of how the proposed system should operate and interact with its users and its external interfaces under a given set of circumstances. The scenarios tie together all parts of the system, the users, and other entities by describing how they interact, and may also be used to describe what the system should not do.

Operational scenarios should be described for all operational modes, transactions, and all classes of users identified for the proposed system. For each transaction, provide an estimate of the size (use maximum, if variable) and frequency (e.g., average number per session). Identify if there any transactional peak periods and include an estimate of frequency during those periods. Each scenario should include events, actions, stimuli, information, and interactions as appropriate to provide a comprehensive understanding of the operational aspects of the proposed system.

The scenarios can be presented in several different ways: 1) for each major processing function of the proposed system, or 2) thread-based, where each scenario follows one type of transaction type through the proposed system, or 3) following the information flow through the system for each user capability, following the control flows, or focusing on the objects and events in the system. The number of scenarios and level of detail specified will be proportional to the perceived risk and the criticality of the project.

## 7. Detailed Design

Instructions: Provide the information needed for a system development team to actually build and integrate the hardware components, code and integrate the software components, and interconnect the hardware and software segments into a functional product. Additionally, address the detailed procedures for combining separate COTS packages into a single system.

- Composition - A description of the use and meaning of the subservices that are a part of the service
- Users/Interactions - A description of the service's collaborations with other services (what other services use this this entity? what other services does this entity use (including any side-effects this service might have on other parts of the system)? this includes the method of interaction, as well as the interaction itself. Object-oriented designs should include a description of any known or anticipated sub-classes, super-classes, and meta-classes)
- Processing - A description of precisely how the service goes about performing the duties necessary to fulfill its responsibilities (this should encompass a description of any algorithms used; changes or state; relevant time or space complexity; concurrency; methods of creation, initialization, and cleanup; and handling of exceptional conditions)
- Interfaces/Exports - The set of services (resources, data types, constants, subroutines, and exceptions) that the service provides (the precise definition or declaration of each such element should be present, along with comments or annotations describing the meanings of values, parameters, etc.; for each service element described, include or provide a reference in its discussion to a description of its important software service attributes (Component Identifier, Classification, Language, SLOC Estimate, Definition, Responsibilities, Requirements, Internal Data Structures, Constraints, Composition, Uses/Interactions, Resources, Processing, and Interfaces/Exports))

### 7.5 Internal Communications Detailed Design

Instructions: If the system includes more than one component, there may be a requirement for internal communications to exchange information, provide commands, or support input/output functions. Provide enough detailed information about the communication design to correctly build and/or procure the communications components for the system. Include the following information in the detailed component designs, as appropriate:

- Number of servers and clients to be included on each area network
- Specifications for bus timing requirements and bus control
- Format(s) for data being exchanged between components
- Graphical representation of the connectivity between components, showing the direction of data flow (if applicable), and approximate distances between components (information should provide enough detail to support the procurement of hardware to complete the installation at a given location)
- LAN topology

## 8. System Integrity Controls

Instructions: Provide design specifications for the following minimum levels of control and any additional controls as appropriate or necessary:

- Internal security to restrict access of critical data items to only those access types required by users/operators
- Audit procedures to meet control, reporting, and retention period requirements for operational and management reports
- Application audit trails to dynamically audit retrieval access to designated critical data
- Standard tables to be used or requested for validating data fields
- Verification processes for additions, deletions, or updates of critical data
- Ability to identify all audit information by user identification, network terminal identification, date, time, and data accessed or changed.

## 9. External Interfaces

Instructions: Describe any interfaces that exist with external systems that are not within the scope of the system being designed, regardless whether the other systems are managed by CMS or another entity. Describe the electronic interface(s) between the system being designed and each of the other systems and/or subsystem(s), emphasizing the point of view of the system being designed. If there are more than one or two external systems, or if the interfaces are not simplistic, one or more separate Interface Control Documents (ICDs) should be prepared and referenced here. If applicable, identify how many ICDs exist and what they are. A template for an ICD is available from the CMS Integrated IT Investment & System Life Cycle Framework Web site located at [https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/Downloads/InterfaceControlDocument.docx](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/Downloads/InterfaceControlDocument.docx).

### 9.1 Interface Architecture

Instructions: Describe the interface(s) between the system being developed and other systems (e.g., batch transfers, queries, etc.), indicating the location of the interfacing system. Include the interface architecture(s) being implemented (e.g., wide area networks, gateways, etc.) and the interfacing mechanisms (e.g., MQ, Gentran, etc.) If remote connectivity is required, identify the method of access. Provide a diagram depicting the communications path(s) between this system and each of the other systems, which should map to the context diagram(s) provided in the Section for System Overview. The graphical representation should depict the connectivity between systems, showing the direction of data flow. Use subsections or a separate ICD(s) to address each interface independently.

### 9.2 Interface Detailed Design

Instructions: For each external system with which the system being designed interfaces, describe the information exchange and rules governing the interface. Provide enough detailed information about the interface to correctly format, transmit, and/or receive data across the interface. Generally, this information should be documented in a separate ICD(s) that should be referenced within this section. A template for an ICD is available from the CMS Integrated IT Investment & System Life Cycle Framework website located at [https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/Downloads/InterfaceControlDocument.docx](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/Downloads/InterfaceControlDocument.docx).
