# Database Testing:

## Data Integrity Checks:

It is vital for the app's functionality to ensure the integrity of data contained in the app's database. Though not directly managed by Fastlane, automated database tests can be programmed using frameworks such as XCTest or specialist database testing tools. These tests check the precision of data insertion, retrieval, and updates, protecting against data corruption or inconsistency.

## Data Migration Testing:

When introducing updates or changes to the database structure, automated tests can be put up to guarantee that data migration operations run smoothly and without damaging current data. This ensures that the skin app's functionality and user data integrity are preserved even after updates or migrations.

## Tools Used:

**a. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):**
- *Description:* SSMS for SQL Server database management and querying.
- *Purpose:* Interact with the database, execute queries, and manage database objects.

**b. MySQL Workbench:**
- *Description:* MySQL Workbench for MySQL database management.
- *Purpose:* Perform tasks such as data modeling, SQL development, and administration.

**c. Database Testing Frameworks (e.g., DbUnit, DBUnitJdbcRules):**
- *Description:* Testing frameworks specifically designed for database testing.
- *Purpose:* Automate database testing, ensuring consistent and reliable results.

## Security Considerations:

**a. Encryption:**
- *Requirement:* All sensitive data in the database must be encrypted.
- *Testing:* Verify the implementation of encryption mechanisms for sensitive data.

**b. Access Controls:**
- *Requirement:* Implement proper access controls to restrict unauthorized access to the database.
- *Testing:* Confirm that users have appropriate permissions and roles to access specific database objects.

**c. Data Masking:**
- *Requirement:* Implement data masking for sensitive information in non-production environments.
- *Testing:* Verify that sensitive information is appropriately masked in testing environments.

## Database Requirements:

**a. Data Schema:**
- *Requirement:* Define and maintain a clear and efficient database schema.
- *Testing:* Validate that the schema supports the application's data requirements.

**b. Data Integrity:**
- *Requirement:* Ensure data integrity constraints are defined and enforced.
- *Testing:* Conduct tests to verify that data integrity is maintained during various operations.

**c. Indexing:**
- *Requirement:* Optimize database performance through proper indexing.
- *Testing:* Assess the effectiveness of indexes in improving query performance.

## Database Testing Plan:

**a. Unit Testing:**
- *Objective:* Verify individual database components.
- *Details:* Test database objects such as tables, views, and stored procedures in isolation.

**b. Integration Testing:**
- *Objective:* Validate interactions between the application and the database.
- *Details:* Test how data is stored and retrieved during various application workflows.

**c. Data Migration Testing:**
- *Objective:* Ensure data integrity during migrations and upgrades.
- *Details:* Test the process of migrating data from one version of the database to another.

**d. Performance Testing:**
- *Objective:* Assess the database's performance under different loads.
- *Details:* Measure response times for complex queries and assess overall database scalability.

**e. Security Testing:**
- *Objective:* Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the database.
- *Details:* Test access controls, encryption, and other security measures.

**f. Backup and Recovery Testing:**
- *Objective:* Ensure data recoverability in case of failures.
- *Details:* Test the backup and recovery processes to verify data can be restored successfully.
