# Roles & Responsibilities

## Scrum Master Activities

### Product Backlog Maintenance 
This explains what is a product backlog and why is it necessary to maintain for SQA

#### What is a Product Backlog? 
List of priortised deliverables (e.g. features). This can contain tasks that yet to be implemented for product development such as features, bugs, tests, user stories etc.

#### Importance of maintaining product backlog

Disorganised product backlog leads to difficulty in priortising tasks and generating sprints for the team. Sprints are key in agile methodlogies and to the process. If this is hindered the progression of product development plummets due to missed schedules and tasks that are vital to product delivery to meet functional and non-functional requirement. This can have consequences on majority of software development phases. Eventually, you will have a failed project. Ultimately, effective product backlog maintence is a key focus for the Scrum master to capacitate agile development.

##### Benefits 
* Adaptability - help guarantee felxibility in the backlog to integrate changing requirements
* Efficiency - no confusion as clear and prioritised tasks, thus faster progression
* Prioritization - guides the team to high-value tasks which align with product development and delivery schedule
* Transparency - promotes visibility for team and stakeholders. Key players are aware where they stand and what work needs to be complete.
 
### What needs to be incorported in our methods // tasks for the scrum master (@sossboyj)

Some examples

* Encourage stakeholder / product owner (@sossboyj) colloabration
  understand their priorties and facilitate alignment with product goal
* Evaluate product backlog items (PBI)
  based on market conditions, customer feedback & business objectives
* Promote cross-functional Communication
  clarify requirements, identify dependencies, insure shared understanding
* Clarity and Granuality
  tasks are broken down into manageable tasks

### Scrum Master relationship with the Product Owner
The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog. As the product owner is the "Voice of the Customer", they have to define the requirements to illustrate their needs and wants from this product. Thus vital for Scrum master to collaborate with the product owner and adopt techniques to clearly communicate the desires to the whole team.

#### Techniques to implement for successful collaboration
* Include in project needs
* Help product owner develop relationship with team and stakeholders
* Position product owner in Scrum Team
* Facilitate product owner in overcoming challenges

### Sprint Planning
#### Proposed tasks for @sossboyj
@sossboyj Scrum Master
    meet with the team (period of time) and check to see that everyone understands the task and objectives of the sprint
       further teach how to priortise tasks and track their proogress through the sprint,
   end of sprint task: is everyone focused on what needs to be done and who is reponsible for what expected outcomes // also update product backlog accoordingly
#### Responsiibilities
* establishing timelines,
* communicate the goals and tasks,
* co-ordinate between teams and stakeholders (communication plans),
* comm. product vision etc.

### Managing Impediments

key role in identifying complications that slow the team significantly. Especially blocks that prevent development of a quality product or performance of any team member
  esclate the issue and priotize impediments with development and dellivey rrequirerments in mind

### Protect Team from External Influennces 
Key role in identifying factors that can impact team members ability to progress. Ensure the tasks are manageable, stress-free environment (product owner or other departments are not pushing team members beyond their capabilities in certain time constraints) etc. 

### Teach and Coach
Scrum master is responsible for teaching and coaching the team in areas that creating difficulties. Provide guidance on how to implement the taught method.
