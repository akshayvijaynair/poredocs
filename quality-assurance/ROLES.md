# Roles & Responsibilities

## Scrum Master Activities

### Product Backlog Maintenance 
This explains what is a product backlog and why is it necessary to maintain for SQA

#### What is a Product Backlog? 
List of priortised deliverables (e.g. features). This can contain tasks that yet to be implemented for product development such as features, bugs, tests, user stories etc.

#### Importance of maintaining product backlog

Disorganised product backlog leads to difficulty in priortising tasks and generating sprints for the team. Sprints are key in agile methodlogies and to the process. If this is hindered the progression of product development plummets due to missed schedules and tasks that are vital to product delivery to meet functional and non-functional requirement. This can have consequences on majority of software development phases. Eventually, you will have a failed project. Ultimately, effective product backlog maintence is a key focus for the Scrum master to capacitate agile development.

##### Benefits 
* Adaptability - help guarantee felxibility in the backlog to integrate changing requirements
* Efficiency - no confusion as clear and prioritised tasks, thus faster progression
* Prioritization - guides the team to high-value tasks which align with product development and delivery schedule
* Transparency - promotes visibility for team and stakeholders. Key players are aware where they stand and what work needs to be complete.

### Scrum Master relationship with the Product Owner
The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog.

#### Responsiibilities
* establishing timelines,
* communicate the goals and tasks,
* co-ordinate between teams and stakeholders (communication plans),
* comm. product vision etc.

### Managing Impediments

key role in identifying complications that slow the team significantly. Especially blocks that prevent development of a quality product or performance of any team member
  esclate the issue and priotize impediments with development and dellivey rrequirerments in mind

### Protect Team from External Influennces
