# Roles

## Scrum Master Activities

### Product Backlog Maintenance 
This explains what is a product backlog and why is it necessary to maintain for SQA

#### What is a Product Backlog? 
List of priortised deliverables (e.g. features). This can contain tasks that yet to be implemented for product development such as features, bugs, tests, user stories etc.

#### Importance of maintaining product backlog

Disorganised product backlog leads to difficulty in priortising tasks and generating sprints for the team. Sprints are key in agile methodlogies and to the process. If this is hindered the progression of product development plummets due to missed schedules and tasks that are vital to product delivery to meet functional and non-functional requirement. This can have consequences on majority of software development phases. Eventually, you will have a failed project. Ultimately, effective product backlog maintence is a key focus for the Scrum master to capacitate agile development.
